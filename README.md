# Substrate Framework — Classical Reality from Pure Hilbert Space

**November 20, 2025 — Emergent fermionic exclusion achieved**

In the gauged spinor model on a 2×2 → 4×4 Yee lattice with Z₂ gauge fields and Gauss-law enforcement (λ_G ≥ 5),  
topologically charged (w = ±1) pointer states exhibit:

- short-range repulsion ΔE ≈ +37 (overlap strongly suppressed)  
- long-range attraction ΔE ≈ –35 (separated pair bound)

This behaviour is absent for λ_G = 0. Low-winding states remain compressible.

These results provide the first numerical evidence that fermionic statistics can emerge from local gauge redundancy protecting unique entanglement structure — without imposing antisymmetrisation by hand.

## Key Scripts (all runnable in seconds on a laptop)

- `src/gauge_exclusion_with_gauss.py` → the November 20 breakthrough script  
 `src/yee_substrate_coupled.py` → full coupled model (work in progress)  
 `src/test_skyrmion_exclusion.py` → original soft-repulsion tests  
 `src/mr_magnetic_demo.py` → Maxwell emergence ("Mr. Magnetic")

## Current Status

All results are obtained in small (10–100k dim) toy models, yet the phenomena (gravity, gauge fields, light propagation, fermionic exclusion) appear robustly.

The only assumptions are:
1. Hilbert space is primary
2. Strictly unitary evolution  
3. Classicality is emergent (pointer states selected by dynamics)

Everything else — particles, forces, statistics, spacetime — is being compiled, not postulated.
