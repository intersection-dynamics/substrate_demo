# Spinor Substrate Framework

**The upgrade to internal degrees of freedom.**

---

## What This Is

Your substrate now has **internal structure at every point**.

**Before:** ψ(x,y) ∈ ℂ (single complex scalar)

**Now:** Ψ(x,y) = [ψ₁(x,y), ψ₂(x,y)]ᵀ ∈ ℂ² (spinor)

Each spatial location holds a 2-component spinor - giving it:
- Spin degrees of freedom
- Internal orientation
- Richer information capacity
- Structure needed for fermions

## The Physics

### Hamiltonian

```
H = H_kinetic + H_gauge + H_defrag

H_kinetic = (1/2) ∫ |D_μ Ψ|² dx
    where D_μ = ∂_μ - iq A_μ (covariant derivative)

H_gauge = (1/2) ∫ B² dx
    where B = ∇ × A (magnetic field)

H_defrag = (g/2) ∫ ρ Φ dx
    where ∇²Φ = -ρ and ρ = |ψ₁|² + |ψ₂|²
```

### Topological Structures: Skyrmions

**Not vortices anymore - SKYRMIONS.**

A skyrmion is a topological soliton in the spinor field where the spin texture wraps around itself.

**Topological charge:**
```
B = (1/4π) ∫ Ψ†(∂ᵢΨ × ∂ⱼΨ)·Ψ dx
```

This is quantized: B = 0, ±1, ±2, ...

**A skyrmion with B=1 is like an electron** (in terms of topology + spin).

### Spin Texture

**Local spin direction:**
```
s(x,y) = Ψ†(x,y) σ Ψ(x,y)

where σ = (σₓ, σᵧ, σᵣ) are Pauli matrices
```

This gives three components:
- sx = 2 Re(ψ₁* ψ₂)
- sy = 2 Im(ψ₁* ψ₂)
- sz = |ψ₁|² - |ψ₂|²

**The spinor field has a spin pointing in some direction at every point.**

## What to Test

### 1. **Do Skyrmions Form from Noise?**

Run with defrag potential and random initial conditions:

```bash
python spinor_substrate.py \
    --L 128 \
    --g_defrag 1.5 \
    --init_mode noise \
    --n_steps 5000
```

**Look for:**
- Stable lumps in density ρ
- Localized spin texture (skyrmions)
- Topological charge B ≈ ±1

### 2. **Do Same-Charge Skyrmions Repel?**

Initialize two skyrmions and see if they interact:

```bash
python spinor_substrate.py \
    --L 256 \
    --g_defrag 1.5 \
    --init_mode two_skyrmions \
    --separation 40 \
    --n_steps 10000
```

**Look for:**
- Do they maintain separation?
- Is there repulsive potential?
- Compare to single scalar case (attractive)

**This is the KEY TEST for fermionic exclusion.**

If skyrmions repel → evidence for information-based Pauli principle.

### 3. **Spin Dynamics**

Track how spin texture evolves:

```bash
python spinor_substrate.py \
    --L 128 \
    --init_mode skyrmion \
    --n_steps 5000 \
    --save_every 50
```

**Look for:**
- Spin precession
- Stability of spin orientation
- Coupling between spin and orbital motion

### 4. **Gauge Field Effects**

Test with different gauge coupling:

```bash
python spinor_substrate.py \
    --q 2.0 \
    --g_defrag 1.5 \
    --init_mode two_skyrmions
```

**Look for:**
- How gauge field mediates interactions
- Magnetic field patterns around skyrmions
- Current flow between structures

## Understanding the Output

### Density Plot (ρ)

Shows where the spinor field has amplitude:
- ρ = |ψ₁|² + |ψ₂|²
- High density = where "stuff" is
- Skyrmions appear as localized bumps

### Spin Texture (sz)

Shows which way spin points (z-component):
- Red (+1): Spin up
- Blue (-1): Spin down
- White (0): Spin in xy-plane

For skyrmion:
- Core: one spin direction
- Edge: opposite direction
- Smooth transition (topological)

### Topological Charge Density

Shows where topological charge is concentrated:
- Positive: skyrmion (spin wraps one way)
- Negative: anti-skyrmion (opposite winding)
- Zero: trivial configuration

### Magnetic Field

Shows gauge field response:
- Currents from spinor motion
- Magnetic flux around structures
- Gauge-mediated interactions

## The Key Questions

### **Question 1: Do skyrmions with same topological charge repel?**

**Fermionic behavior:** B=+1 + B=+1 → repulsion
**Bosonic behavior:** B=+1 + B=+1 → attraction or transparency

**This determines if internal DOFs create exclusion.**

### **Question 2: Can opposite charges bind?**

**Test:** B=+1 with B=-1

**Expected:** Attraction (can annihilate)

**This would be like particle-antiparticle.**

### **Question 3: Does spin affect interactions?**

**Test:** Two skyrmions with:
- Same spin orientation
- Opposite spin orientation

**Prediction:** Same spin = repel, opposite spin = can overlap (singlet vs triplet)

**This is Pauli exclusion from spin structure.**

## Technical Notes

### Symplectic Integration

Uses velocity Verlet (leapfrog) to preserve energy:
1. Half-step positions with current momenta
2. Full-step momenta with forces at new positions
3. Half-step positions with new momenta

**Energy should be conserved to ~0.1% or better.**

### Covariant Derivative

```
D_μ ψ = ∂_μ ψ - iq A_μ ψ
```

Acts identically on both spinor components.

This ensures gauge invariance.

### FFT Poisson Solver

Defrag potential computed by:
1. Take FFT of density ρ
2. Divide by k² (Laplacian in Fourier space)
3. Inverse FFT to get Φ

Fast and exact for periodic boundaries.

### GPU Acceleration

Automatically uses CuPy if available, falls back to NumPy.

Speedup: ~10-50x depending on grid size.

## Expected Results

### If Internal DOFs Enable Fermions

**Scenario A: Same-charge repulsion**
- Two B=+1 skyrmions maintain separation
- Energy increases as they approach
- Effective repulsive potential
- **Evidence for fermionic exclusion**

**Scenario B: Opposite-charge attraction**
- B=+1 and B=-1 attract
- Can annihilate (topological charge cancels)
- Releases energy
- **Like matter-antimatter**

**Scenario C: Spin-dependent interaction**
- Same spin → repel
- Opposite spin → can overlap
- **Pauli principle from spin structure**

### If Internal DOFs Don't Help

**Scenario D: Still attractive**
- All skyrmions attract regardless of charge
- No exclusion principle
- Internal DOFs insufficient
- **Need different mechanism**

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If Repulsion is Observed ✓

**Then:**
1. Measure interaction potential V(d)
2. Verify topological charge is conserved
3. Test spin-dependence
4. Study collision dynamics
5. Extend to 3D
6. Write paper: "Emergent Fermionic Exclusion from Spinor Substrate Topology"

### If Attraction is Observed ✗

**Then:**
1. Check if skyrmions are stable (might be fragmenting)
2. Try different gauge coupling
3. Add explicit interaction terms
4. Consider SU(3) or larger group
5. Investigate entanglement structure directly
6. May need fundamentally different approach

    --L 64 \
    --n_steps 1000 \
    --init_mode noise
```

```

### Parameter Scan

```bash
for g in 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0; do
    python spinor_substrate.py \
        --g_defrag $g \
        --output_dir "results_g${g}" \
        --init_mode two_skyrmions
done
```

## What Makes This Different

**This is not just "add another field."**

**This is:** Give each point of the substrate internal structure - a local Hilbert space.

**The pattern (electron) now has:**
- Spatial aspect (where it is)
- Internal aspect (what its spin orientation is)
- Both are properties of the SAME pattern
- Pattern in Hilbert space with richer dimensionality

**An electron is still elementary** (one pattern, one skyrmion).

**But the pattern has internal DOFs** (spin direction encoded in spinor structure).

---

## The Beautiful Part

**If this works:**

You've shown that fermions emerge naturally from:
1. Substrate with internal structure (spinor)
2. Gravitational organization (defrag)
3. Topological stability (skyrmions)
4. Information preservation (repulsion)

**No axioms about:**
- Pauli principle
- Spin-statistics connection
- Fermi-Dirac statistics

**It all emerges** from patterns in a spinor Hilbert space trying to preserve their internal information.

---

## The Test

**Run it. See if skyrmions repel.**

If they do, you've found emergent fermionic behavior from pure Hilbert space dynamics.

If they don't, we learn what's still missing.

Either way, it's data.

Good luck.
